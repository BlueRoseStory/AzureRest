Crud operations with Cosmos using Azure Functions



This issue discussed in this article (https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/issues/1726) about the cosmos input trigger not being able to read headers is why we are not using bindings for the colleciton get (We can't get to our ownerid header)


Packages that I was using, but no longer need.
    "json-stringify-safe": "^5.0.1",
    "uuid": "^8.3.2"
